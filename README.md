Please refer to the below paper for the detailed description. 

Zhu W, Huang H, Zhou Y, Shi F, Shen H, Chen R, Hua R, Wang W, Xu S, Luo X. Automatic segmentation of white matter hyperintensities in routine clinical brain MRI by 2D VB-Net: A large-scale study. Front Aging Neurosci. 2022 Jul 29;14:915009. doi: 10.3389/fnagi.2022.915009. PMID: 35966772; PMCID: PMC9372352.

Code includes the implementation of the network for 2D segmentation.

Data includes the example data with the image (t2flair-stripped.nii.gz), ground-truth segmentation (gt.nii.gz), and network's result (seg.nii.gz).

Mode includes the pre-trained model to be used in the network.
